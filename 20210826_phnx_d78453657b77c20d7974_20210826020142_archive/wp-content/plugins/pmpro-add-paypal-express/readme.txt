Stable tag: .6

Appeal to the highest number of potential customers by offering PayPal as a payment option in addition to your onsite credit card payment gateway.

== Description ==

This plugin enables a radio select on the membership checkout page, allowing a user to select their preferred payment method for purchase. PayPal offers peace of mind to buyers that have concerns paying you directly by giving them a layer of protection when making purchases online.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'pmpro-add-paypal-express' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Setup ==
1. Navigate to the Memberships > Payment Settings admin page.
1. Select the 'PayPal Express' gateway from the 'Payment Gateway' dropdown list.
1. Enter your PayPal Express API key, username, and password set in the appropriate fields [docs].
1. Click 'Save Settings'.
1. Now (after inputting your PayPal Express settings and clicking save), switch back to your primary gateway by selecting your gateway from the 'Payment Gateway' dropdown list.
1. Click 'Save Settings'.
1. The PayPal Express settings will be remembered 'in the background'.

Navigate to your Memberships Checkout page and preview the new 'Choose Your Payment Method' box. We also advise testing checkout via PayPal to ensure that the connection is working.

== Important Notes ==

You do not need to activate this plugin with PayPal Website Payments Pro. PayPal Express is automatically an option at checkout with that gateway.

This plugin will only work when the primary gateway is an onsite gateway. At this time, this includes:
* Stripe
* Braintree
* Authorize.net
* PayPal Payflow Pro
* Cybersource
